# TUI User Guide

**Application:** `rpa-script`  
**Source:** `rpascript/tui.py` → `rpascript/tui_adapter.py` (TuiAdapter class)

---

## 1. Overview

The TUI (Terminal User Interface) is an interactive application for working with
Ruida laser controllers directly from the terminal. It combines:

- **Session management** — connect to and disconnect from controllers over UDP or USB
- **Script execution** — run rpascript (`.rds`) files as jobs in real time
- **Capture import** — decode captured tshark traffic from other applications
  (LightBurn, RDWorks, MeerK40t) into editable scripts
- **Script generation** — save decoded sessions as `.rds` files for playback
- **Real-time monitoring** — live memory usage, GC object counts, and controller
  status updates
- **Visualization** — interactive Bokeh plots of head moves and cut paths

### Intended use

The TUI is intended to be used only for discovery and diagnostic purposes and
is NOT for a production environment. Jobs requiring thousands of layer actions
should not be run using the TUI because of the overhead involved.

---

## 2. Launching

```bash
# If installed
rpa-script

# From source directory
python rpascript/tui.py
```

No arguments needed — the TUI starts immediately. If a script file is provided
as an argument, it is processed in batch mode instead (see `rpa-script --help`).

### Auto-starting the RPC server

Launch the TUI with the RPyC RPC server automatically started using `--rpc`
together with `--tui`:

```bash
rpa-script --tui --rpc
# With non-default host/port/token:
rpa-script --tui --rpc --rpc-host 0.0.0.0 --rpc-port 19001 --rpc-token secret
```

Defaults are host `localhost`, port `18812`, and no token. `--rpc` is only valid
together with `--tui`; `--rpc-host`, `--rpc-port`, and `--rpc-token` are only valid
together with `--rpc`. This is equivalent to typing `server start` in the TUI.
Localhost connections always skip TLS and token authentication; a token is only
enforced when `--rpc-host` is a non-local address.

If the RPC port is already in use (for example, another TUI instance is running),
an auto-start reports the failure on an error screen — press **Escape** to exit —
and the process exits with a non-zero status. Starting the server manually with
`server start` under the same condition just logs the error and leaves the TUI
running.

Three main areas:

**Left panel (log area)**
- Main `RichLog` widget showing commands sent, replies received, system messages,
  and error logs. Scrolling history of the last 1000 lines.

**Right panel (side panel)**
- **Top: status/reply log** — real-time controller status updates (connection
  state changes, ping events, query replies) with dim text styling.
- **Bottom: monitor panel** — two tables updated every 15 seconds:
  - **Memory stats**: VmRSS, VmSize, VmPeak, and Thread count for the TUI process
    with per-interval changes (yellow highlight) and cumulative totals.
  - **GC object counts**: Per-class instance count and deep memory footprint for
    Ruida protocol objects tracked by the garbage collector. Class names appear
    in **[orange]** when the measurement hit the recursion depth limit (500 levels),
    indicating the reported size is a partial count.

**Bottom bar**
- **Command input**: text input for entering commands
- **Status bar**: connection state and transport info (e.g., `Connected | UDP 192.168.1.100:50200`)

---

## 4. Session Management

### Connecting

```
session start udp=192.168.1.100
session start udp=192.168.1.100 usb=ttyUSB0 to=10s
session start udp=192.168.1.58 proto=tcp
```

Parameters:
- `udp=<IP>` — Controller IP address (required if no USB)
- `usb=<device>` — USB serial device (e.g., `ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyACM0`).
  Can be combined with UDP; USB is preferred when both are specified.
- `to=<timeout>` — Connection timeout. Formats: `5s`, `5000ms`. Default: 5000ms.
- `magic=0xNN` — Optional swizzle magic number (e.g., `magic=0x88`).
- `proto=udp|tcp` — Optional network protocol for the `udp=` host. Default `udp`;
  use `tcp` for controllers that only accept TCP, such as the RDC8445S.

The TUI remains responsive while connecting. Use `/stop` or **Escape** to cancel
a pending connection.

### Disconnecting

```
session end
```

Stops the background script runner, disconnects the transport, and cleans up
all background threads.

### Connection Lifecycle

1. **Connecting** — Pinging controller, waiting for reply
2. **Connected** — Controller responding, status monitor active
3. **Disconnected** — Lost connection, auto-reconnect in progress
4. **Terminated** — Session explicitly shut down via `session end`

When a connection is lost unexpectedly, the TUI automatically retries
connection in the background. A `DISCONNECTED` event is logged, and the
status bar updates to reflect the state.

---

## 5. Command Input

The TUI classifies each line of input into one of several categories,
processed in this order:

### 5.1 Session Meta-Commands

```
session start udp=192.168.1.100
session end
server start host=0.0.0.0 port=19001 cert=server.crt key=server.key token=secret
server stop
```

Directives that control the connection lifecycle, handled internally
without involving the controller.

`server start` launches the RPyC RPC server (host defaults to `localhost`,
port `18812`, no token); `server stop` shuts it down. The `--rpc` launch
flag is equivalent to `server start` (see Section 2).

### 5.2 Jog, Home & Job-Control Commands

The 16 jog commands, 3 homing commands, and 4 job-control commands are bare
commands (no `/` prefix) that act on the live session:

```
home                            # Jog X and Y axes to the origin reference
home_z                          # Home Z axis
home_u                          # Home U axis (rotary)
pause                           # Pause the current job
resume                          # Resume the paused job
stop_job                        # Stop the current job
reset                           # Stop the job and home X and Y axes
jog_xy_to 10 20             # Jog XY to absolute position (mm)
jog_x_to 50                 # Jog X to absolute position (mm)
jog_y_to 50                 # Jog Y to absolute position (mm)
jog_z_to 5                  # Jog Z to absolute position (mm, max 2000)
jog_u_to 30                 # Jog U to absolute position (mm)
jog_xy_rel                  # Jog XY relative ([x] [y] optional — uses configured defaults)
jog_x_rel 5                 # Jog X relative ([x] optional)
jog_y_rel 5                 # Jog Y relative ([y] optional)
jog_z_rel 2                 # Jog Z relative ([z] optional)
jog_u_rel 2                 # Jog U relative ([u] optional)
jog_set_xy_speed 150        # Set XY jog speed (mm/s)
jog_set_z_speed 50          # Set Z jog speed (mm/s)
jog_set_u_speed 50          # Set U jog speed (mm/s)
jog_set_xy_rel 25           # Set relative XY jog distance (mm)
jog_set_z_rel 10            # Set relative Z jog distance (mm)
jog_set_u_rel 10            # Set relative U jog distance (mm)
```

- **Live-only semantics** — movement jogs, homing (`home`, `home_z`,
  `home_u`), and job-control commands (`pause`, `resume`, `stop_job`,
  `reset`) run immediately against a connected controller (requiring an active
  session) and are never persisted to `.cglu` files; `jog_set_*` setters
  configure the live jog session (speeds and relative distances) and never
  produce gluescript lines.
- **Autocomplete** — typing a `jog` or `home` prefix in the command input shows
  suggestions with usage text.
- **Help** — `/help` lists all 23 under "Jog, Home & Job-Control commands (live-only)".

### 5.3 Slash Commands

```
/help
/load my-script.rds
/run
```

TUI meta-commands starting with `/` (see Section 6 for full reference).

### 5.4 rpascript Commands

Any valid rpascript command line:

```
HOME_XY
SET_ABSOLUTE
MOVE_FAR_XY X=100mm Y=200mm
CUT_FAR_XY X=200mm Y=100mm
```

Sent to the controller as a single-line script. Requires an active session.

## 6. Slash Commands

| Command               | Description                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/help`               | Display formatted help text covering all command categories.                 |
| `/load <path>`        | Load a `.rds` script file into memory for editing or execution.              |
| `/head <path>`        | Load a `.rds` file as head (prepended to future `/run` and `/list job`).  |
| `/tail <path>`        | Load a `.rds` file as tail (appended to future `/run` and `/list job`).   |
| `/run [<file>]`      | Execute the whole loaded script as raw commands. With an optional `<file>`, first load that `.rds` file (like `/load`), then execute it. A space activates the `.rds` file selector. |
| `/dryrun on\|off`    | Toggle dry-run mode. When on, `/run` runs normally but RPC `driver.run()` only logs to TUI. |
| `/frame job \| /frame layer <N>` | Frame job or layer boundaries via jog moves at 600 mm/S (top-right then bottom-left), relative to the job's detected reference point. Requires loaded script + active session. |
| `/export <path> [magic=0xNN]` | Export the loaded script as a binary `.rd` file. Default path: `<source>.rd`. Supports `magic=0xNN` to override swizzle byte. |
| `/import <path>`      | Import a tshark capture file (`.log`/`.txt`/`.rd`) and decode into a script. |
| `/edit`               | Open the loaded rpascript in a full-screen text editor (Ctrl+S saves, Esc cancels). |
| `/gluescript <sub>`   | GlueScript high-level scripting (`new`, `show`, `stage`, `run`, `save`, `load`, `edit`, `list`, ...). `/gs` is an alias. See the [GlueScript guide](gluescript-guide.md). Loaded `.cglu` files are watched and auto-reloaded when they change on disk (external-editor workflow); auto-reloads skip the `.cglu` autosave write but still write derived `.rds`/`.rd`/`-plot.html`. |
| `/save job\|script\|as <path>` | Save the pure job body (`/save job`, START_JOB to EOF, no head/tail) or the full loaded script (`/save script`; `/save as` is an alias). Bare `/save <path>` defaults to script save. |
| `/autosave <path>`    | Set gluescript autosave base path (saves `.cglu`/`.rds`/`.rd`/`-plot.html` on every gluescript stage). `/autosave off` disables; `/autosave` shows current setting. |
| `/list`               | Show the composed job with section markers (`# --- Head ---` / `# --- Job ---` / `# --- Tail ---`). |
| `/list auto [on\|off]`| Auto-display of RPC scripts.                                                  |
| `/list job`           | Same as `/list`.                                                             |
| `/list script`        | Show only the loaded script (without head/tail).                             |
| `/list head`          | Show the head script.                                                        |
| `/list tail`          | Show the tail script.                                                        |
| `/listeners [full]`   | List listeners registered with the RdDriver; `full` shows each listener repr. Requires a session. |
| `/plot`               | Open an interactive Bokeh visualization of the loaded script.                |
| `/power_scale [status\|on\|off\|max_speed <v>\|floor <v>]` | Show or configure GlueScript effective-min power scaling. `status` (default) shows enabled/max_cut_speed/power_floor; `on`/`off` toggle the flag; `max_speed <v>`/`floor <v>` set the config. |
| `/monitor [on\|off]`  | `/monitor` immediate update; `/monitor on` auto-update every 15s; `/monitor off` disable. |
| `/protect on\|off\|status` | Toggle protect mode. When on, SET_SETTING commands are blocked to prevent hardware damage. |
| `/scan_mem`           | Generate a GET_SETTING script for all MT memory addresses, staged into the loaded script; then `/run` to run or `/list` to review. |
| `/clear`              | Clear all log panels, loaded script, head/tail, and monitor totals.          |
| `/stop`               | Cancel pending session connection or stop script execution. Also on Escape.  |
| `/status on`          | Enable reply logging (controller responses shown in log).                    |
| `/status off`         | Disable reply logging.                                                       |
| `/status status`      | Show whether reply logging is currently enabled.                             |
| `/status connection [on\|off\|status]` | Enable/disable transport-event logging; `status` shows the current state.    |
| `/rpclog [on\|off\|status]` | Toggle verbose RPC server logging (no args toggles).                         |
| `/quit`               | Exit the TUI. Also on Ctrl+C.                                                |

### Error Behavior

### Job Composition

Head and tail scripts are stored by `RdDriver` and applied at execution time.
Each command has a different role:

- **`/run [<file>]`** — executes the whole loaded script as raw commands via
  `driver.run()`. With an optional `<file>`, it first loads that `.rds` file
  (like `/load`) and then executes it. No job extraction is performed; the
  entire script is sent as-is.
- **`/list job`** — uses `_format_job_with_markers()` to display the composed
  script with section comment markers:
  ```
  # --- Head ---
  <head_script lines>
  # --- Job ---
  <job body lines>
  # --- Tail ---
  <tail_script lines>
  ```
  Empty sections show `# (empty)` for clarity.
- **`/save job`** — saves only the pure job body (START_JOB → EOF).
  Head and tail are **not** included, making the output round-trippable:
  it can be reloaded with `/load` and re-executed without double-appending
  head/tail.

If no `START_JOB`/`EOF` markers exist in the loaded script, the job body
is empty. This allows modular workflow: separate head (homing, initialization),
job body, and tail (cleanup, shutdown) scripts. `/run` executes the whole loaded
script as-is, regardless of job markers; job extraction is only used by
`/save job` and the job-composition display (`/list job`).

---

## 7. File Browser

Commands that take a file path (`/load`, `/head`, `/tail`, `/import`,
`/save`, `/save job`, `/save script`, `/save as`, `/autosave`, `/export`,
`/gluescript save`, `/gluescript load`, `/gs save`, `/gs load`) trigger an
interactive file browser when you type a space after the command:

- The tree filters to show only matching file types:
  - `.rds` for `/load`, `/head`, `/tail`
  - `.log`, `.txt`, `.rd` for `/import`
  - All files for `/save`, `/save job`, `/save script`, `/save as`, `/autosave`
  - `.rd` for `/export`
  - `.cglu` for `/gluescript save`, `/gluescript load`, `/gs save`, `/gs load`
- **Tab** toggles focus between the command input and the file tree
- **Enter** uses the path you've typed as-is when you haven't navigated the
  tree; otherwise it backfills the command with the selected file
- **Escape** dismisses the tree
- The tree follows partial paths (e.g., typing `/load /tmp/` starts
  browsing at `/tmp`)
- Navigating into subdirectories is preserved when typing additional
  characters in the same directory

## 8. Importing Captures

The `/import` command converts a tshark packet capture into an editable
rpascript script. This is the primary way to turn traffic from other
applications into reusable scripts.

### The Capture → Import → Save Pipeline

```
LightBurn / RDWorks / MeerK40t
        ↓ (UDP traffic to controller)
./capture <controller_ip> <basename>
        ↓ (.log file with tshark fields)
/import <basename>.log   [magic=0xNN]
        ↓ (RPA decode pipeline → _ImportCollector)
.rds script lines in memory
        ↓
/save job <basename>.rds
        ↓ (.rds file on disk)
```

### Step 1: Capture Traffic

Use the `capture` script to record traffic between a laser application and
the controller:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
./capture 192.168.1.100 my-job

# Windows (PowerShell)
.\capture.ps1 -if Ethernet -ip 192.168.1.100 -out my-job
```

This runs `tshark` in the background, filtering on UDP traffic to/from the
controller's IP address. The output is written to `my-job.log` in tshark
fields format (tab-delimited: time delta, port, length, hex payload).

The script first pings the IP address to verify reachability (warning if
unreachable — capturing with the machine off may be intentional for
diagnosing lost-connection behavior).

### Step 2: Import in the TUI

```bash
# In TUI:
/import my-job.log
```

The `/import` command:
1. Opens the `.log` file and runs the RPA decode pipeline in-process
2. Decodes each binary packet into commands with parameters
3. Collects decoded commands as rpascript lines, preserving reply values
4. Loads the result into `_loaded_script`

If the capture uses a non-default swizzle, specify the magic number:

```bash
/import my-job.log magic=0x9A
```

On success:
```
Imported 847 lines from my-job.log
```

On failure, descriptive error messages are shown (decode errors, file not
found, etc.).

### Step 3: Review and Save

```bash
# Review the full script
/list

# Review the job portion only (between START_JOB and EOF)
/list job

# Save the composed job as a reusable script
/save job my-job.rds
```

The saved `.rds` file can be loaded back into the TUI, passed to
`RdDriver.run()`, or played back with `rpa-script`.

### Importing Binary `.rd` Files

The `/import` command also supports RDWorks binary `.rd` files directly:

```bash
# In TUI:
/import capture.rd
```

This feeds the binary bytes through the same parser pipeline without needing a tshark capture layer. Header comments (`# Source: <filename>`) are added automatically.

On success:
```
Imported 847 lines from capture.rd
```

---

## 9. Working with Scripts

### Loading Scripts

```
/load my-job.rds
```

Loads a `.rds` file into memory. The script is stored as `_loaded_script`
and can be executed or saved.

### Head and Tail

For modular workflow, you can split your script into three parts:

```bash
/head setup.rds          # Commands to prepend (e.g., homing, initialization)
/tail cleanup.rds        # Commands to append (e.g., shutdown, air assist off)
```

Head and tail are shown in `/list job`. `/run` executes the whole loaded
script as raw commands — head/tail are **not** auto-applied to it. `/save job`
saves only the pure job body; head/tail are applied at execution time by the
driver's `run_job()`.

### Viewing

```bash
/list           # Show composed job with section markers
/list script    # Show loaded script only
/list head      # Show head script
/list tail      # Show tail script
```

### Editing

```
/edit
```

Opens the loaded script in a full-screen editor (Ctrl+S saves, Esc cancels).
Saving replaces the loaded script with the edited lines (blank lines are
stripped). The same editor is used by `/gluescript edit` for the gluescript
transcript.

### Executing

```bash
/run             # Execute the whole loaded script as raw commands
/run my-script.rds   # Load my-script.rds, then execute it immediately
```

`/run` executes the entire loaded script as-is via `driver.run()`, without
job extraction or head/tail wrapping. This works for any script, whether or
not it follows the `START_JOB`/`BLOCK_END` structure. With an optional
`<file>`, `/run <file>` first loads that `.rds` file (like `/load`) and then
executes it. A space following `/run` opens the file selector (filtered to
`.rds` files).

`/run` requires an active session.

### Saving

```
/save job my-output.rds
/save script my-script.rds
/save as my-script.rds
```

- `/save job <path>` — saves only the pure job body (START_JOB to EOF) as a
  `.rds` file. Head and tail are NOT included — the output is the same as the
  job portion shown by `/list job` between the section markers. The saved file
  is compatible with `rpa-script` playback, `RdDriver.run()`, and can be
  reloaded with `/load` without double-appending head/tail.
- `/save script <path>` — saves the full loaded script (all lines, including
  head/tail if composed) as a `.rds` file.
- `/save as <path>` — alias for `/save script`.
- Bare `/save <path>` — defaults to `/save script`.

### Autosave

```
/autosave my-job
/autosave off        # Disable
/autosave            # Show current setting
```

The autosave workflow captures gluescript jobs staged through any path:

1. Set the base path with `/autosave <path>`.
2. Stage a gluescript job — either from an RPC client (full stage) or from
   the TUI itself (`/gluescript stage`, `/gluescript run`, `/gluescript load`,
   or `/gluescript edit`).
3. The TUI writes `<path>-<version>.cglu`, `<path>-<version>.rds`,
   `<path>-<version>.rd`, and `<path>-<version>-plot.html` on each stage.

`/autosave off` disables autosave; `/autosave` with no argument shows the
current setting. The RPC server is not required — autosave works for TUI
staging too. Autosave does not fire on RPC delta stages.

### Plotting

```
/plot
```

Opens an interactive Bokeh visualization in your browser showing all
individual head moves from the loaded script:

- **Hover** over a vector for a tooltip with move command ID, endpoint
  coordinates, length, power, and speed.
- **Filter** by move type (moves/cuts), power range, and speed range.
- **Right-click** for a context menu, including opening a new tab filtered
  from that command.

![Example:](example-moves.png)

Requires `bokeh` to be installed (`pip install ruida-pa`) and a virtual
environment active.

### Clearing

```
/clear
```

Clears all log panels, the loaded script, head and tail scripts, and
resets all memory monitor totals.

---

## 10. Monitor Panel

The bottom-right panel displays two tables, updated every 15 seconds:

### Memory Stats

```
        VmRSS KB  VmSize KB  VmPeak KB  Threads
Mem:       47100     541348     542264       15
Change:        0       +100          0        0
Total:         0      +1000          0        0
```

- **Mem**: Current values from `/proc/self/status` (VmRSS, VmSize, VmPeak, Threads)
- **Change**: Difference since the previous update (yellow highlight for non-zero)
- **Total**: Cumulative change since the TUI started (no highlight — stable baseline)

### GC Object Counts

```
Class                 Count         Mem      Change       Total
TransportEvent            9         432       +96        +192
RpaArea                   5         240           0           0
RdStatusEvent            11         528           0         +48
```

- **Class**: Name of the Ruida protocol class tracked by the garbage collector.
  Shown in **[orange]** when the recursive memory measurement hit the depth
  limit (500 levels), meaning the reported size is partial.
- **Count**: Number of live instances.
- **Mem**: Deep memory footprint in bytes (sum of all reachable objects, not
  just the shell size).
- **Change**: Memory delta since the previous update (yellow for non-zero).
- **Total**: Cumulative delta since the TUI started.

The depth limit prevents stack overflow from deeply nested object graphs.
Classes marked in orange are those where at least one instance had a
deeper-than-500 tree, so the reported memory is a lower bound.

Use `/clear` to reset all monitor totals.

## 11. Introspection

The TUI provides interactive inspection of internal objects:

```
?              # List available introspection objects
?driver        # Inspect the current RdDriver state
?session       # Inspect the current RdSession state
?transport     # Inspect the transport layer
?status        # Inspect the status monitor
?parser        # Inspect the ScriptParser
?decoder       # Inspect the RdDecoder
?self          # Inspect the TuiAdapter itself
```

Advanced method calls use `!` prefix:

```
!driver.is_connected
!session.status.is_blocked
!decoder.decode_address(0xDA, 0x01)
```

See the built-in help (`/help`) for full syntax details.

## 12. Example Workflows

### Example A: Capture from LightBurn → Convert to Script

```bash
# Terminal 1: capture controller traffic from LightBurn
./capture 192.168.1.100 my-job
```
*(Run the laser job from LightBurn while capture is running)*

```bash
# Terminal 2: import and save in the TUI
rpa-script
```
```
/import my-job.log
Imported 847 lines from my-job.log

/list job
[displays first 3 lines of the job]

/save job my-job.rds
Job saved to my-job.rds (652 lines)
```

Result: `my-job.rds` contains the decomposed job, ready for replay or
modification.

### Example B: Capture from RDWorks → Load → Execute

```bash
# Capture the session
./capture 192.168.1.100 rdworks-test
```
```bash
# Launch TUI and import
rpa-script
/import rdworks-test.log
Imported 1423 lines from rdworks-test.log

# Connect and execute
session start udp=192.168.1.100
[STATUS] PING_REPLIED
[STATUS] CONNECTED

/run
[SCRIPT] Executing loaded script (478 lines)...
[replies appear as controller processes]
```

### Example C: Import → Visualize with /plot

```bash
./capture 192.168.1.100 panel-cut
rpa-script
```
```
/import panel-cut.log
Imported 320 lines from panel-cut.log

/plot
```
*(Bokeh server opens in browser showing the toolpath visualization)*

![Example:](example-moves.png)

### Example D: Full Workflow with Head/Tail Composition

```bash
./capture 192.168.1.100 front-panel
rpa-script
```
```
/import front-panel.log
Imported 950 lines from front-panel.log

# Add homing preamble
/head home.rds
Loaded 3 lines from home.rds

# Add shutdown sequence
/tail finish.rds
Loaded 2 lines from finish.rds

# Review the full composition with section markers
/list job
# --- Head ---
SET_ORIGIN
MOVE_FAR_XY X=0mm Y=0mm
LASER_OFF
# --- Job ---
START_JOB
LAYER_PROMPT "Default"
...
EOF
# --- Tail ---
MOVE_FAR_XY X=0mm Y=0mm

# Save pure job body (head/tail not included)
/save job front-panel-complete.rds
Job saved to front-panel-complete.rds (795 lines)
# Note: /save job includes only the job body (795 lines).
# Head (3) and tail (2) are applied at execution time by the driver.
```

### Example E: Export a Script as Binary `.rd`

After importing or loading a script, export it as a binary `.rd` file:

```
/import capture.log
Imported 847 lines from capture.log

/export
Wrote 883 bytes to capture.rd
```

The exported `.rd` is compatible with RDWorks and can be re-imported with `/import`.

---

## 13. Integration

Scripts produced by `/save job` are compatible with:

- **`rpa-script` playback**: `rpa-script my-job.rds -o output.tshark`
- **`RdDriver.run()`**: Machine-consumed by the library API
- **Re-import**: Load back into the TUI for modification

The `.rds` format is documented in detail in the
[rpascript guide](rpascript-guide.md).
