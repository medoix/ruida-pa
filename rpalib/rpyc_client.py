"""Client-side batching wrapper around the RPyC service root,
mirroring the RdDriver surface.

``RpcRdDriver`` wraps an RPyC service root and exposes the same
job-scripting and lifecycle-execution surface as the direct RdDriver,
but with local batching so a whole job reaches the server in a few
round trips instead of one per command. It inherits from ``GlueScript``
(``class RpcRdDriver(GlueScript)``), exactly mirroring how the direct
driver does (``class RdDriver(GlueScript)``), so the buffered authoring
methods, validation, and live-command surface are shared with the direct
driver; the RPC-specific batching, drift guard, and close semantics are
layered on top via the ``_on_action_boundary`` hook, while the
job-control commands (``pause``, ``resume``, ``stop_job``, ``reset``)
are overridden to forward directly to the server. The constructor opens
its own TCP connection (via the module-level
``connect_rpc()`` helper) when no ``svc`` is supplied; a caller-provided
connected root (``connect_stream(...).root``, as in
tests/rpyc_poc/test_auth.py) is still accepted as the first positional
argument, exactly as before.

Token handshake
---------------
``connect_rpc()`` speaks the length-prefixed token protocol implemented
by the server authenticator (rpalib/rpyc_service.py):
- ``token=None``: send NOTHING. This pairs with the default token-less
  server (``start_rpyc_server(token=None)``), which installs no
  authenticator and never reads a handshake.
- ``token`` a non-empty str: send a 1-byte length prefix followed by
  the UTF-8 token bytes. A token longer than 255 UTF-8 bytes raises
  ``ValueError`` — the length prefix is a single byte.
- ``token=""``: send the documented empty-token prefix ``b"\\x00"``,
  accepted as the localhost path by authenticator-enabled servers.
  tests/rpyc_poc/test_auth.py's ``_client_connect`` sends ``b"\\x00"``
  for ``token=None`` — a convention predating this one, deliberately
  unchanged because that file tests the authenticator itself.

Timeout semantics
-----------------
The socket timeout set by ``connect_rpc()`` bounds the TCP connect and
the handshake send; every RPC afterward is bounded by rpyc's
``sync_request_timeout`` config, which the helper merges in as
``timeout``. A socket ``settimeout`` is never consulted by rpyc's poll
path, so it would not bound RPCs.

Close semantics
---------------
``close()`` is idempotent and closes only connections the driver opened
itself (``_owns_connection``); caller-provided roots are left to their
owner. After ``close()`` the ``_svc`` reference is swapped for a
closed-sentinel whose attribute access and calls raise
``RuntimeError("driver closed")``, and ``is_connected`` reads False.
``RuntimeError`` (not ``AttributeError``) is deliberate: ``_flush()``
treats ``AttributeError`` as "old server without the delta method", so
a closed driver must never be mistaken for an old server.

Batching semantics
------------------
- Structural calls are buffered locally and mirrored into ``_transcript``:
  ``declare_job``, ``declare_layer``, ``comment``, ``inline``
  (until ``end_job()``), ``set_power_scaling_enabled``, and the layer
  actions (``move_*_to``,
  ``cut_*_to``, ``power``, ``power_range``, ``set_mode``, ``set_overscan``,
  ``air_assist_*``). Each flush — at
  ``declare_layer`` or ``end_job`` — sends ONLY the newly appended lines
  (the delta) to ``stage_gluescript_delta()``, which replays the suffix
  onto the server's existing state WITHOUT reset (O(Δ) per flush instead
  of O(L·N)).
- ``new_gluescript`` and post-``end_job()`` ``comment``/``inline``
  are forwarded immediately: ``new_gluescript`` resets
  the server so its transcript length returns to 0 (matching
  ``_flushed_count``), and the post-``end_job`` epilogue is the only way
  lines reach the server after the last flush boundary (forwarded
  epilogue lines break ``len(server) == _flushed_count``; ``sync()`` or a
  new ``declare_job()`` restores the invariant). ``set_power_scaling_enabled``
  follows the same pattern: mirrored locally, forwarded immediately once
  ``end_job()`` has run.
- ``add_layer_action``, ``update_position``, jogs, and homing stay
  forwarded-only as today.
- Validation now happens at call time, exactly as on the direct driver:
  ``declare_layer`` (mode/overscan/min_power) and ``power_range``
  (layer/min>max/min<8%) raise ``ValueError`` immediately; ``power``
  warns and drops on a wrong layer mode or a ``None`` percentage. The
  ``_job_complete`` fail-fast guards on ``declare_layer`` and
  ``power_range`` (post-``end_job``) are preserved.

Drift guard
-----------
Every flush compares the SHA-256 signature returned by the server with a
locally computed digest of the full transcript; ``get_gluescript()`` is
read back via the getters ONLY when the signatures differ, to identify
the point of drift. A match proves the server's state equals the
client's belief without transferring the transcript back over the wire.
Any mismatch raises ``RuntimeError`` naming the first differing index —
fail fast, fail loud.

Delta contiguity
----------------
``stage_gluescript_delta()`` requires the server transcript length to
equal the client's ``_flushed_count``. When contiguity is broken (e.g.
an external ``stage_gluescript()`` call or mid-job driver recreation on
the server, or a post-``end_job()`` epilogue followed by another flush),
the server raises ``GlueScriptDeltaMismatchError`` and the client falls
back to a full ``stage_gluescript()`` re-stage, which re-baselines
``_flushed_count`` on success. A server without the delta method (older
version) triggers the same full-stage fallback via ``AttributeError``.

Public ``stage_gluescript()`` passthrough
-----------------------------------------
``stage_gluescript()`` forwards the call unchanged (including
``gluescript=None`` for finalizing the current job), returns the SHA-256
signature string from the server, and does not touch the local transcript
or run the drift check.

Getter semantics
----------------
``gluescript`` and ``job_complete`` are now LIVE LOCAL state, consistent
with the direct driver: ``gluescript`` returns the client's buffered
transcript (``_transcript``, including unflushed lines) and
``job_complete`` reads the local ``_job_complete`` flag set by
``end_job()``. ``rpascript`` remains a server snapshot of the last-flushed
assembled rpascript. The retained method aliases ``get_gluescript()`` and
``get_rpascript()`` return the server's last-flushed state (so the
``gluescript`` property and ``get_gluescript()`` diverge: the property is
live local, the method is the server snapshot). ``sync()`` re-baselines
the transcript, ``_flushed_count``, ``_current_layer_mode`` and
``_job_complete`` from that last-flushed state.

The attribute forms (``gluescript``, ``rpascript``, ``job_complete``,
``machine_status``, ``protect_enabled``, ``is_connected``), the
lifecycle/execution passthroughs (``start``, ``stop``, ``run``,
``run_job``, ``cancel_script``, ``set_protect``, and the head/tail
script setters and getters), the listener registration surface
(``register_status_listener``, ``register_error_listener``,
``register_reply_listener`` and their ``unregister_*`` counterparts),
the format utilities (``format_reply_value``, ``format_reply``,
``format_reply_list``, ``decode_status_value``), and the staging
passthroughs (``stage_gluescript``, ``stage_gluescript_delta``) mirror
the direct RdDriver surface, so an app adapter needs no separate
direct-vs-RPC path. The z/u move and cut stubs (``move_z_to``,
``move_u_to``, ``cut_z_to``, ``cut_u_to``) raise ``NotImplementedError``
exactly as the direct driver does.
